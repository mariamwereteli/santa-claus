            <h1>Who is santa claus</h1>
            <p>Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick,</p>
            <p>Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, is a legendary figure</p>
            <p>originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts during the late evening</p>
            <p>and overnight hours on Christmas Eve. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves,</p>
            <p>who make the toys in his North Pole workshop, and with the aid of flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air</p>
